## Why

We currently have a high-fidelity UI design for a Pomodoro timer in `clock_dark.pen`. To bring this design to life and make it a functional interactive web application, we need to set up a robust frontend project foundation including React, Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, and shadcn ui.

## What Changes

- Initialize a new React project using Vite with the TypeScript template.
- Configure ESLint for standard code quality and consistency.
- Set up Tailwind CSS, which is a prerequisite for shadcn ui.
- Initialize shadcn ui for rapid, accessible UI component building.
- Set up the basic project directory structure (e.g., components, utils) to prepare for the full UI implementation of the timer.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `frontend-foundation`: Setting up the core React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind, and shadcn ui stack to build the pomodoro application.

### Modified Capabilities

## Impact

- Creates the initial frontend codebase for the Tomato Clock web application.
- Sets the development standard with TypeScript and ESLint.
- Establishes shadcn ui as the core component library for building out the UI from the `.pen` file.
