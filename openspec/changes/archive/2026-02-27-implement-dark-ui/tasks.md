## 1. Setup and Preparation
- [x] 1.1 Analyze `clock_dark.pen` to extract exact colors, typography settings, padding, and gap values.
- [x] 1.2 Create a barebones React component structure in `src/components/` (e.g., `ModeSelector.tsx`, `TimerDisplay.tsx`, `Controls.tsx`, `ProgressTracker.tsx`).

## 2. Component Implementation
- [x] 2.1 Implement `ModeSelector` component with Focus, Short Break, and Long Break buttons.
- [x] 2.2 Implement `TimerDisplay` component with a circular SVG ring and countdown text.
- [x] 2.3 Implement `Controls` component with Start, Pause, Reset buttons and Auto/Manual toggle.
- [x] 2.4 Implement `ProgressTracker` component with round indicators for session progress.

## 3. Integration and Polish
- [x] 3.1 Assemble components in `App.tsx` matching the overall layout from the design.
- [x] 3.2 Ensure responsive behavior (centers correctly, looks good on mobile).
- [x] 3.3 Verify visual accuracy against the original `.pen` design.
